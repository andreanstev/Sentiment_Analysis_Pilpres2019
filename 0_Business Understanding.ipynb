    "# **Sentiment Analysis Pilpres 2019 Tweet**\n",
    "\n",
    "X, formerly known as Twitter (2006-2023), was an American social networking service that allowed users to post and interact with short messages called tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter is one of the social media used as a place to comment or express opinions. Here we have a collections of various tweet about Indonesia Presidential Election in 2019. The tweet consist of comment and opinions of both candidate pair, whether it have positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment analysis of tweets related to the 2019 Indonesian presidential election is a critical task for understanding public opinion and gauging the political climate. By analyzing tweets, which are rich in real-time reactions and opinions, we can uncover insights into voter sentiments, key concerns, and trending topics. These insights are invaluable for political strategists, campaign managers, social scientists, and policymakers to make informed decisions and tailor their strategies accordingly."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a dataset of tweets related to the 2019 Indonesian presidential election, our objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of each tweet. The sentiment will be classified into categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance will be accuracy. This metric is chosen for its straightforward interpretation and its ability to provide a clear measure of how well the model correctly classifies sentiments."

    "\n",
    "To ensure the success of our predictive model and its alignment with business goals, we will focus on the following business metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy of Sentiment Classification**: The degree to which the predicted sentiments align with actual sentiments, helping stakeholders understand public opinion accurately.\n",
    "2. **Campaign Effectiveness**: The impact of improved understanding of voter sentiment on the effectiveness of campaign strategies and voter engagement.\n",
    "3. **Public Perception**: The level of positive reception and trust among the public towards the campaign based on their responses and interactions on social media."

    "\n",
    "To achieve our objective, we will develop and compare two types of models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forest Classifier**: As a baseline model, the Random Forest classifier will be used for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling classification tasks.\n",
    "2. **Deep Learning Model (LSTM)**: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, we will build a more advanced model capable of capturing the sequential nature of text data, aiming to improve the prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps will involve data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Post model evaluation, we will interpret the results, analyze feature importance, and deploy the model for real-time sentiment analysis."
